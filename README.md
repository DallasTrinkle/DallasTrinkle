- 👋 Hi, I’m @DallasTrinkle, Racheff Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
- 👀 I’m interested in computational materials science algorithms for atomic scale simulation:
- * dislocations via lattice Green functions
- * diffusion via variational principle
- * efficient model Hamiltonian construction
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can; my group mainly studies metals but we're always interested in branching out to other material systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new algorithms for better materials modeling
- 📫 Reach me at [my research group website](https://dtrinkle.matse.illinois.edu)
